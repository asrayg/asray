    <h1>Education</h1>

    <h3>Iowa State University</h3>
    <h4>Involvement</h4>
    <ul>
      I did entrepreneurship, leadership, research, and innovation work at Iowa State. Brought myself outside my shell.

      <br><br>

      <strong>ARA Wireless Labs Research Intern (2024)</strong><br>
      Did experiments on experimental networks. Built hardware and made cool software. My final thesis was a LoRAMesh sensor hub — a low-cost, solar-powered mesh device that uses edge AI to detect soybean crop health and pest activity, transmitting data over long-range networks to give farmers real-time insights without internet access. It was cool. Realized research and PhDs weren’t for me, but it was okay because I was able to apply a lot of my research into practice for an engineering final project.

      <strong>Moothedath Research Intern (2025)</strong><br>
      Machine learning research on making satellites communicate better.

      <br><br>

      <strong>Student Government Liberal Arts and Sciences Senator (2022–2024)</strong><br>
      <strong>Student Government United Residents Off Campus Senator (2024–2025)</strong><br>
      <strong>Student Government Legislative Ambassador (2023–2025)</strong><br>
      <strong>United Residents Off Campus Council President (2024–2025)</strong><br>
      <strong>United Residents Off Campus Council Vice President (2023–2024)</strong><br>
      I really liked Student Government and made a lot of changes and got a lot of projects done. Had to quit when it got less about helping students and more about other members trying to help out their friends in the org. I served as a senior member and got to meet some cool people along the way.

      <br><br>

      <strong>Algorithmic Trading Club President (2025–2026)</strong><br>
      Had an interest in algo trading and finance, so I restarted this club with Arjun Patel, a dear friend. It started off with rocky numbers, but I’m proud of how it’s evolving.

      <br><br>

      <strong>Oak-Elm Hall Council President (2022)</strong><br>
      Got impeached. I came off too strong and tried to make too many changes too fast, and the rest of the council didn’t like that, so they had me impeached in my second meeting. Oh well. God forbid I try to make changes in an organization.

      <br><br>

      <strong>Solar Car Software Team Engineer (2022–2024)</strong><br>
      <strong>Solar Car Strategy Team Engineer (2022–2024)</strong><br>
      <strong>Solar Car Interim Business Manager (2024)</strong><br>
      Learned a lot about teamwork and project management here. Got to work with some really talented people and learned how to manage a large team. Shoutout Nick!

      <br><br>

      <strong>Start Something LAS Academy Fellow (2023–2025)</strong><br>
      Probably the better thing I did at ISU. Learned a lot about entrepreneurship, innovation, and how to start something from scratch. I’m glad I got to learn from Jeff Bull and so many others.

      <br><br>

      <strong>Computer Science Advisory Board Chair (2025–2026)</strong><br>
      <strong>Computer Science Advisory Board Member (2024–2025)</strong><br>
      Didn’t get too much done as a member, but as chair I wanted to make more of an impact so I really changed how we ask the department to run things. There’s no holding back, and other board members appreciate that I share true, honest feedback.

      <br><br>

      <strong>Student and Mayoral Appointee to CyRide Board of Trustees (2024–2025)</strong><br>
      I LOVE CYRIDE AND I’M GLAD I GOT TO SERVE ON THEIR BOARD. Elected member and got commended by the mayor.

      <br><br>

      <strong>ISUPD Advisory Board Member (2022–2024)</strong><br>
      Got to serve as a student member and had good discussions about fire and e-scooter safety with Chief Newton.

      <br><br>

      <strong>Sigma Nu Tau (2025–lifetime honor)</strong><br>
      Your boy’s first honor society. This is for entrepreneurship, and I got free money from it.

      <br><br>

      <strong>Cardinal Key (2025–lifetime honor)</strong><br>
      Forgot I applied to this and didn’t pay the fees, but they still inducted me. I don’t know why.

      <br><br>

      <strong>President’s Leadership Class (2022–2025)</strong><br>
      Got to learn leadership from the big cheese at the university, President Wintersteen. Learned a bit, but I feel like real leadership comes from learning through experience.
    </ul>

    <h3>Sri Chaitanya Pre University College</h3>
    Hated this place. Very high-pressure environment. Only cared about marks. Glad to be out of it.

    <h3>Ekya School ITPL</h3>
    Didn’t like this place either.

    <h3>May Watts & Cowlishaw</h3>
    Where I did my early schooling
